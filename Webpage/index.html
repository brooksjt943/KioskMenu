				<h2>Who made this kiosk?</h2>
				<p>We are a small team of Sandhills students who came together with one task: to put together this kiosk you're seeing now. We had a few goals in mind when we started: to create a strong first impression for anyone interested in the Sandhills Computer Technology program; to provide helpful information to students, visitors and guests of our department at Little Hall; and to build an extensible, workable platform for future students to build upon this kiosk. </p>
				<p>This was and is, in fact, a student project -- everything you're seeing here is for a grade! It's our hope that future students will take this kiosk on as their own project, and extend it with new modules and updates to existing features. That way, this resource will grow and accomodate the needs of the Computer Technology department, and students will get a chance to work on and ship a project of their own.</p>
